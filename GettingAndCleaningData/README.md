## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked from the course website represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

### Content:


* `run_analysis.R`: Script used to do the tasks of the project:
  + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  + From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


* `CodeBook.md`: Description of the variables and process to clean up the data.
* `tidy_data.txt`: Resulting data set.
